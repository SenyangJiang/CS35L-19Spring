1.
command: wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
command: wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
command: wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg
Download coreutils-8.29 tarball, the signature and GNU keystring

command: gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
The signature is verified without running into problems

2. 
command: tar -xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
unzip the tarball

command: mkdir ~/coreutilsInstall
make a directory for installing coreutils

command: cd coreutils-8.29
go to the directory of unzipped coreuntils files

command: emacs INSTALL
read the '--prefix' flag under the 'configure invocation' section

command: ./configure --prefix=/u/eng/class/classsen/coreutilsInstall
run the configure script using the prefix flag with directory /u/eng/class/classsen/coreutilsInstall

command: make
compile the files

command: make install
install files to the directory /u/eng/class/classsen/coreutilsInstall

3.
command: cd ~/coreutilsInstall/bin
go into the directory of the installed binary file of coreutils-8.29

command: ./ls -a -A
The bug causes this command to output file names including . and .. (the home and parent directory)

The first two lines of output are:
 .          csplit      fold      mktemp     readlink    stat       uname
 ..         cut         groups    mv         realpath    stdbuf    unexpand
4.
command: cd ~/coreutils-8.29
go to the directory that contains the source file

Then copy the content of the patch into a file called 'lspatch'

command: patch -p1 <lspatch
It creates the following massage:
Hunk #1 FAILED at 4.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file NEWS.rej
patching file src/ls.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 1900 (offset -3 lines).
patching file tests/local.mk
patching file tests/ls/a-option.sh

The NEWS file patching failed because no file with this name exists in the directory
Apart from this, the message shows that the patching is successful

5.
command: autoreconf
remake GNU build system files that are older than their sources.
In this case, src/ls.c, tests/local.mk, tests/ls/a-option.sh are updated by the patch
So we need to run autoreconf to remake these files

command: make
build the fixed version

command: cd src
Enter the source file directory where the modfied ls command is located

6.
command: ./ls -a -A
This command does not output . and ..
so the bug has been fixed by the patch

the first two lines of output are:
'['                         nice.c
 b2sum                      nice.o
