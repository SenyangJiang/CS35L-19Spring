We start by verifying that the problem still occurs in /usr/bin/ls
command: /usr/bin/ls -a -A ~
the first two lines of output are:
.                          .cshrc           junk       proj1
..                         Desktop          lab2.log   .python_history

we can see . and .. are printed, so the problem still occurs in /usr/bin/ls

We next check the version of /usr/bin/ls
command: /usr/bin/ls --version
ls (GNU coreutils) 8.22
so the Coreutils version is 8.22

1.
command: wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
command: wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
command: wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg
Download coreutils-8.29 tarball, the signature and GNU keystring

command: gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
gpg: Signature made Wed 27 Dec 2017 10:29:05 AM PST using RSA key ID 306037D9

There is a warning that this key is not certified with a trusted signature,
because I have not marked the key as trusted

2. 
command: tar -xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
unzip the tarball

command: mkdir ~/coreutilsInstall
make a directory for installing coreutils

command: cd coreutils-8.29
go to the directory of unzipped coreuntils files

command: emacs INSTALL
read the '--prefix' flag under the 'configure invocation' section

command: ./configure --prefix=/u/eng/class/classsen/coreutilsInstall
run the configure script using the prefix flag with directory to install

command: make
compile the files

command: make install
install files to the directory /u/eng/class/classsen/coreutilsInstall

3.
command: cd ~/coreutilsInstall/bin
go into the directory of the installed binary file of coreutils-8.29

command: ./ls -a -A ~
The bug causes this command to output file names including . and ..

The first two lines of output are:
.                          .cshrc           junk       proj1
..                         Desktop          lab2.log   .python_history

4.
command: cd ~/coreutils-8.29
go to the directory that contains the source file

Then copy the content of the patch into a file called 'lspatch'

command: patch -p1 <lspatch
It creates the following massage:
Hunk #1 FAILED at 4.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file NEWS.rej
patching file src/ls.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 1900 (offset -3 lines).
patching file tests/local.mk
patching file tests/ls/a-option.sh

The NEWS file patching failed because no file with this name exists
Apart from this, the message shows that the patching is successful

5.
command: autoreconf
remake GNU build system files that are older than their sources.
In this case, ls.c, local.mk, a-option.sh are updated by the patch
So we need to run autoreconf to remake these files

command: make
build the fixed version

command: cd src
Enter the source file directory where the modfied ls command is located

6.
command: ./ls -a -A ~
the first two lines of output are:
assign2.html               Desktop          junk       .profile~
.bash_history              Documents        lab2.log   proj1

This command does not output . and ..
so the bug has been fixed by the patch

We make sure that the old version of ls still produces the bug
command: cd ~/coreutilsInstall/bin
command: ./ls -a -A ~
the first two lines of output are:
.                          .cshrc           junk       proj1
..                         Desktop          lab2.log   .python_history
