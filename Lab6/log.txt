First I check whether /usr/local/cs/bin is added to the PATH environment variable:
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/cs/bin is printed as the first entry

Then I check the version of coreutils:
$ sort --version
sort (GNU coreutils) 8.31
This version is newer than 8.6

=========================================================================
Generate a file with 2^24 random floating point numbers

I first explore the 'od' man page to find the necessary option:
$ man od
-N specifies the number of bytes we want to dump in the input file, in this case is 2^24 bytes
-An is used to prevent from printing the offset from the start of each line
-t fF specifies the output format is float

Then generate a file with 2^24 random single-precision floating point numbers:
$ od -An -t fF -N $((2**24)) < /dev/urandom | 
$ tr -s [:blank:] '\n' |
$ sed '/^$/d' > output.txt

tr -s [:blank:] '\n' is used to replace the spaces between each floating point number with newline, and the -s option removes extra empty line between the numbers
sed '/^$/d' removes an empty line at the start of the file

=========================================================================
time the sort command without and with --parallel option

Use time -p to time the command 'sort -g' on the file we just created
$ time -p sort -g output.txt > /dev/null
Result:
	real 8.52
	user 45.03
	sys 0.21

Then I check how to use the --parallel option
$ sort --help
I found that I should specify --parallel=N, where N is the number of threads

Then I run sort with 1, 2, 4, 8 threads with the time command:
<1 thread> 
$ time -p sort -g --parallel=1 output.txt > /dev/null
Result:
	real 43.07
	user 42.94
	sys 0.11

<2 threads> 
$ time -p sort -g --parallel=2 output.txt > /dev/null
Result:
	real 23.10
	user 43.95
	sys 0.10

<4 threads> 
$ time -p sort -g --parallel=4 output.txt > /dev/null
Result:
	real 13.32
	user 44.52
	sys 0.15

<8 threads>
$ time -p sort -g --parallel=8 output.txt > /dev/null
Result:
	real 8.60
	user 45.01
	sys 0.18

We can see that as the number of threads increases, the time taken by the sort programs decreases. 
Furthermore, the time taken by the sort command without specifying the --parallel option is similar to time taken by the sort using 8 threads.
