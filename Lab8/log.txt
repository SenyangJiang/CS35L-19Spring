Lab environment setup
$ dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
openssh-client                                  install
openssh-server                                  install
openssh-sftp-server                             install

openssh-server and openssh-client are installed

Server-side Setup

Create user name for the client:
$ sudo useradd -d /home/senyang -m senyang
-m means create home directory for the new user "senyang"
-d specifies the path of the home directory

Then update the password by:
$ sudo passwd senyang

Create .ssh directory for new user "senyang":
$ cd /home/senyang
$ sudo mkdir .ssh

Transfer ownership .ssh directory to user "senyang"
$ sudo chown -R senyang .ssh

-R means change ownership recursively

Change permission on .ssh directory:
$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh
This gives only user "senyang" the right to read, write and execute

I looked at my ip address using:
$ ifconfig
My ip address is 172.29.8.16, which would be used by my partner Scott

======================================================================
Client-side

First generate a pair of public and private keys using:
$ ssh-keygen
The keys are saved to default file ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Set passphrase to "senyang" 

Then I run ifconfig on my partner's terminal to get his IP address:
172.29.9.169

Then copy my public key to the server:
$ ssh-copy-id -i jiang@172.29.9.169
Enter the password "1234jiang"
The public key has been copied to the server

Add private key to ssh-agent:
$ eval $(ssh-agent)
$ ssh-add
Enter the passphrase "senyang" for my private key
The private key has been added to the ssh-agent

SSH to Scott's server:
ssh -X jiang@172.29.9.169
I am logged in to the server without entering password

Create a file in my home directory:
$ touch test
by using "ls" command, I see that the file has been successfully created in the server

Open firefox:
$ firefox
The firefox window is opened on my computer (though it is very slow)
